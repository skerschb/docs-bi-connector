The schema generation tool :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` outputs a schema
file in :ref:`Document Relational Definition Language <drdl>` (DRDL)
format. Examine the generated schema's table structure and field types
to verify that the generated schema supports your reporting
requirements.

You can manually edit the schema definition files to perform the
following actions:

- Add fields that :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` did not discover within
  the subset of documents that it sampled
- Remove fields
- Remove tables
- Rename tables, so long as the ``collection`` field remains the same
- Rename fields using the ``sqlname`` option

When you're done editing your ``.drdl`` file, you can either:

- Use :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` to :commandoption:`upload` the schema
  to your MongoDB deployment.

- Run :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` with the
  :option:`--schema <mongosqld --schema>` option to specify the
  ``.drdl`` when launching ``mongosqld``.
