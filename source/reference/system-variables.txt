|bi-short| provides the following environment variables:

.. include:: /includes/fact-system-vars.rst

Setting System Variables
------------------------

You must have the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role to set environment
variables on an Atlas-hosted |bi-short|. To set them for an on-premises
|bi-short|, you must have the :authaction:`inprog` privilege on the
MongoDB database to which you've connected the |bi-short|.

Use any SQL client that is connected to |bi-short| to set these
variables. The following example sets ``mongodb_max_varchar_length``
to ``100``:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   SET GLOBAL mongodb_max_varchar_length = 100

You must start a new connection to the |bi-short| after setting a system
variable. The connection you used to set the system variable is not affected.
