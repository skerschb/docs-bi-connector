HolaThe following steps describe how to create a system Data Source
Name (DSN) for the :program:`mongosqld` process. A DSN is a
saved configuration which describes a database
connection to be used by an ODBC driver. Once defined and registered,
a DSN can be used to connect to the BI Connector from several MySQL
clients.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating a :abbr:`DSN (Data Source Name)`, you should:

- Download and install the :doc:`C Authentication Plugin
  </tutorial/install-auth-plugin-c>` for your
  platform from the `releases page
  <https://github.com/mongodb/mongosql-auth-c/releases>`_.

- Download and install the `MySQL Connector/ODBC driver
  <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/>`_ for your
  platform.
