  Using the procedure above, add the following keywords:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 50 50
     :header-rows: 1
  
     * - Keyword
       - Value
  
     * - **SERVER**
       - The hostname or IP address of the |bi| host.

         .. important::

            Use ``127.0.0.1`` to connect via TCP to localhost.
            Specifying a value other than an IP address, will attempt to
            connect via Unix socket.

     * - **PORT**
       - The :abbr:`IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)`
         `port number <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml>`_
         for the |bi|. The default is ``3307``.

     * - **DATABASE**
       - The database to use after connecting.

         .. note::

            Required when connecting with Microsoft Excel.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-odbc-parameters.rst

  For example, your user DSN configuration should look similar to
  the following:

     * - ``SSLMODE``
       - Set to ``REQUIRED``.

     * - ``SSLCA``
       - The path to the SSL certificate authority file.

     * - ``SSLCIPHER``
